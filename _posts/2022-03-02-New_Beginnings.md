# NEW BEGINNINGS

I really had to think about how to spell beginnings..
#### be·gin·ning  (bĭ-gĭn′ĭng)

The start of something new. I'm fully embracing the new moon energy today to share a bit about my beginnings which is now.

If you think about it, every beginning is an end and all ends are beginnings.

### WHY you should embrace the new moon energy?

New Moons present us with new opportunities, new beginnings and paths.
This new moon in Pisces is one of the luckiest times of the year. Falling in Pisces, the energy of the water sign will stimulate the collective unconscious. It is the final zodiac on the wheel before the start of *ARIES SZN*. This new moon signifies endings, resolutions, and the evolutions of the human spirit. This period can be used to reflect on what has been built and experienced over the year. 

I'm a firm believer in energy and the stars. We are made up of the same matter that is the universe, if the moon can affect the oceans then sure as hell the planets can affect our 75% water bodies.

>"Change is hard at first, messy in the middle and beautiful in the end." -Robin Sharma

I stumbled upon this quote while reading "The 5 AM Club" by Robin Sharma and it stuck with me since. 

I've spent most of my life believing I wasn't good enough. Surrounding myself with people who didnt have good interests, people who used me, people who made me feel like dirt. But really I allowed myself all that, I didn't have limits nor boundaries. I wasn't sure of what I wanted nor who I was.

I would get asked about myself and frankly didnt know how to answer. 
Here is the speech about "Who I was": 
>Hi I'm Mariantonia, call me Mari. I'm from Colombia, but I was raised in Miami. I play sooccer and I like movies.

I think about it now and it makes me a grateful. 

`Let us dissect.`

1. I hated since the first time they called me Mari, yet I lacked a courage to say anything agaimst it. 

I get called Ti, MAG or Antonia now. I don't settle for people mispronouncing my name either. It is my pride, my heritage, my power.

2. I carry my nationality with pride and joy.

Criolla. 
 
3. I lacked the discipline to continue playing soccer in highschool and I got lazy and bored with it too. But I'm still an athlete.

I do yoga everyday now. It's saved my life.

### Everything in life is an experience.

I have so many experiences that have led me to this moment. To this moment where I am dedicated to my art, my life and my health.

One of the biggest factors have been NFTs. Non-Fungible Tokens. I first joined in Febuary of 2021. Best experience ever so far. 

Nfts have allowed me as an artist to really blossom and break my limits every day. They have also allowed me to make friendships with some amazing people and create a community far beyond the reach of my city. 

This Pisces moon makes me really realize this. I am just at the beginning and what a great beginning it is. A year ago I didnt know what I was doing, now here I am sitting writing in my own blog about how I am starting this lifechanging jouney as an artist, curator, collector, and most importantly as a beautiful being with endless capacities to change and explore.

I hope to show y'all more about me MAG and the MAGTRIX that is my mind, post by post, piece by piece. I reveal my nature and my programming. 

Thank you for being on this journey with me.

Stay connected.
