# Welcome to the MAGtrix 
### This is my world, you're just living in it


I am not very good with introductions. They always cause me anxiety ever since I was a kid. I remember having to do icebreakers in school for the first day. It was terrible. 
So many personal questions to so many strangers always put me on edge. When I grew older, I just starteed not going the first few days of class, avoided it all together.

BUUUUUT Thats not who I am anymore. I am working on stepping out of my anxoety. Social anxiey is a pain really but
#### DAY BY DAY BRICK BY BRICK, WE BUILD.

Anyways,,,,,,, I'M Antonia, BUT I like to be called
