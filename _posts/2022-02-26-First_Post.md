# Welcome to the MAGTRIX
### This is my world, you're just living in it


I am not very good with introductions. They always cause me anxiety ever since I was a kid. I remember having to do icebreakers in school for the first day. It was terrible. 
So many personal questions to so many strangers always put me on edge. When I grew older, I just starteed not going the first few days of class, avoided it all together.

BUUUUUT Thats not who I am anymore. I am working on stepping out of my anxiety. Social anxiey is a pain really but

Anyways,,,,,,, I'm Antonia, BUT I like to be called

**I am an imaginationalist and I believe in being exceptional. I am a multidsiciplinary artist. I am a multidimensional being with depths like the ocean.**

I have been creating art since I have memory and recollection. I have loved color and the absence of color, form, space since I could remember. I am a lover of pattern, and repetion. I love ranndomization and impulsivity. I create on instinct.

But I only started seeing myself as an artist through using technology.

An avid gamer growing up, technology and coding have always been interesting to me. However, I lacked the confidence to do anything really. It wasn't until COVID-19 started.
2020.
The year my life changed. 

I truly realized that the one thing I feel most comfortable doing is creating and learning. I came into sync with my inner child and my purpose. 
I dont' expect to know everything, but I know the road I'm going on, and I'm prepared and growing every day.

Part of my process of growing and becoming a better artist everyday is getting organized, hence this blog.

Here to host my ideas, my thoughts, my dreams, my fears, my work, everything and anything.

I'm bringing unchained exceptionalism. 

Again...
