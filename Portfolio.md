# PORTFOLIO


As a multidisciplinary artist, my work varies on medium.
In this is my photography, my painting, my generative art, my NFTs, my music and anything else I make.

## NFTS

$ETH$ (Ethereum)
>This is my [FOUNDATION](https://foundation.app/@magtrix "MAGTRIX"). The CrÃ¨me de la CrÃ¨me.. My beautiul photgraphy collection lies here, its growing here too.
>
>This is my [OpenSea (BROKEN SEA)](https://opensea.io/magtrix1 "MAGRIX"). Here lies the first collection I minted on the Blockchain. It has sentimental value. And will be worth a lot in a few years.  ðŸš€


$XTZ$ (Tezos)
>This is my [OBJKT Marketplace](https://objkt.com/@magtrix "MAGTRIX").  Pure bliss. Pure experiments.
>
>This is my [Rarible](https://rarible.com/magtrix1/sale "MAGTRIX"). A single piece.
