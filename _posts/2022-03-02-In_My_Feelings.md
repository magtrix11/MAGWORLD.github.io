# NEW BEGINNINGS

I really had to think about how to spell beginnings..
#### be·gin·ning  (bĭ-gĭn′ĭng)

The start of something new. I'm fully embracing the new moon energy today to share a bit about my beginnings which is now.

If you think about it, every beginning is an end and all ends are beginnings.

### WHY you should embrace the new moon energy?

New Moons present us with new opportunities, new beginnings and paths.
This new moon in Pisces is one of the luckiest times of the year. Falling in Pisces, the energy of the water sign will stimulate the collective unconscious. It is the final zodiac on the wheel before the start of *ARIES SZN*. This new moonsignifies endings, resolutions, and the evolutions of the human spirit. This period can be used to reflect on what has been built and experienced over the year. 

I'm a firm believer in energy and the stars. We are made up of the same matter that is the universe, if the moon can affect the oceans then sure as hell the planets can affect our 75% water bodies.

I think about it now and it makes me a grateful. 

`Let us dissect.`

1. I hated since the first time they called me Mari, yet I lacked a courage to say anything agaimst it. 

I get called Ti, MAG or Antonia now. I don't settle for people mispronouncing my name either. It is my pride, my heritage, my power.

2. I carry my nationality with pride and joy.

Criolla. 
 
3. I lacked the discipline to continue playing soccer in highschool and I got lazy and bored with it too. But I'm still an athlete.

I do yoga everyday now. It's saved my life.

I have so many experiences that have led me to this moment. When I was 20 I 
The biggest change in my life this this past year has been my change in thought and attitude.

I'm discussing this because its fundamental to who I am.
